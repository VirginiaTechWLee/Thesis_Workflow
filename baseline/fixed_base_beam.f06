               Welcome to MSC Nastran 2025.1
  
   MSC Nastran brings powerful new features and enhancements for engineering
   solutions in several releases through the year. Key enhancements in
   Version 2025.1 are summarized below. Addtional details can be found in
   the MSC Nastran Version 2025.1 Release Guide.
  
     MSC Nastran 2025.1 Features and Enhancements
  
     High Performance Computing (HPC)
     - Significant performance improvements for FASTFR with GPGPU acceleration
     - Significant performance improvements for acoustic panel participation
       factor calculations
     - FASTFR now enabled for models with frequency dependent properties
     - MUMPS linear solver used to accelerate residual vector computation
       for non-ACMS modal analysis
  
     SOL 200 NEO Topology Optimization
     - New convergence / Progression control for Emendate optimizer
     - Support of frequency/eigenvalue constraints for optimization
     - Support of mode tracking for normal mode optimization
     - Support of Automatic External Super Element (AESO) for normal mode
       Topology optimizations
     - New folder/file structure for a better overview of result files
  
     SOL 200 Dynamic Aero Optimization
     - SOL 200 now supports dynamic aeroelasticity (gust and frequency
       dependent loading)
  
     High Performance SOL 400 (NLPERF)
     - Support Lagrange Multiplier for MPC and Rigid Elements
     - Controls distributed surface load computation for shell elements with
       offsets and the use of an additional enhancement for computing the
       average nodal normal vector
     - GPFORCE and ESE can be requested in ANALYSIS=NLSTAT
     - OUTCTRL={STD,SOLUTION,INTERM} keyword in NLOPRM case control statement is
       available
     - The six node PENTA element is now available for use as a Gasket element
       via use of collapsed eight node CHEXA element
     - The CTRIA3/6 elements with PCOMP(G) are now available for interlaminar
       shears via collapsed CQUAD4/CQUAD8 elements
     - Support output of artificial damping energy
     - Enhancement of VCCT capability
     - Support GRAV for external modules
  
     Linear
     - In all linear solution sequencies and in SOL400 nonlinear, the solid
       composite PCOMPLS now supports the CPENTA element using a collapsed CHEXA
1      element.
  
     Frequency Analysis
     - For frequency dependent elements at interpolated frequencies
       with only CBUSH, CELASi, CDAMPi, or CAABSF type elements
       frequency dependent, STRESS/FORCE response for these
       elements are automatically included in results.
  
  
     Adams MNF Enhancements
     - Adams MNF generation for large models has been significantly sped up.
     - MSC Nastran supports the generation of enhanced MNF files with acoustic
       modes using the uncoupled method, which facilitates the direct recovery
       of acoustic pressure in Adams.  When modeling lighter fluids, the
       uncoupled method is the recommended approach.
  
     Rotordynamics
     - SOL128 analysis to start from previous converged solution. Updated
       NHRMPRM entry to read input OP2 file containing the converged solution
       from previous run and start analysis from frequency of interest.
  
     Superelements and Modules
     - MSC Nastran can now automatically generate gravity loads for external
       superelements and external modules in assembly run. This feature is
       supported for linear soutions and SOL 400 including NLPERF.
     - PLOTEL and PLTSURF are supported between modules
       through MDPLTEL and MDPLTSF respectively.
